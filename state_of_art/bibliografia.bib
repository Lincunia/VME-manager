  abstract = {The evolution of recent malicious software with the rising use of digital services has increased the probability of corrupting data, stealing information, or other cybercrimes by malware attacks. Therefore, malicious software must be detected before it impacts a large number of computers. Recently, many malware detection solutions have been proposed by researchers. However, many challenges limit these solutions to effectively detecting several types of malware, especially zero-day attacks due to obfuscation and evasion techniques, as well as the diversity of malicious behavior caused by the rapid rate of new malware and malware variants being produced every day. Several review papers have explored the issues and challenges of malware detection from various viewpoints. However, there is a lack of a deep review article that associates each analysis and detection approach with the data type. Such an association is imperative for the research community as it helps to determine the suitable mitigation approach. In addition, the current survey articles stopped at a generic detection approach taxonomy. Moreover, some review papers presented the feature extraction methods as static, dynamic, and hybrid based on the utilized analysis approach and neglected the feature representation methods taxonomy, which is considered essential in developing the malware detection model. This survey bridges the gap by providing a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of malware detection model research. This survey introduces a feature representation taxonomy in addition to the deeper taxonomy of malware analysis and detection approaches and links each approach with the most commonly used data types. The feature extraction method is introduced according to the techniques used instead of the analysis approach. The survey ends with a discussion of the challenges and future research directions.},

Although AI models might advance human welfare in unprecedented ways, progress will not occur without substantial risks. This article considers 3 such risks: system malfunctions, privacy protections, and consent to data repurposing. To meet these challenges, traditional risk managers will likely need to collaborate intensively with computer scientists, bioinformaticists, information technologists, and data privacy and security experts. This essay will speculate on the degree to which these AI risks might be embraced or dismissed by risk management. In any event, it seems that integration of AI models into health care operations will almost certainly introduce, if not new forms of risk, then a dramatically heightened magnitude of risk that will have to be managed.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes AdaTest, a novel adaptive test pattern generation framework for efficient and reliable Hardware Trojan (HT) detection. HT is a backdoor attack that tampers with the design of victim integrated circuits (ICs). AdaTest improves the existing HT detection techniques in terms of scalability and accuracy of detecting smaller Trojans in the presence of noise and variations. To achieve high trigger coverage, AdaTest leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce a diverse set of test inputs. Particularly, we progressively generate test vectors with high 'reward' values in an iterative manner. In each iteration, the test set is evaluated and adaptively expanded as needed. Furthermore, AdaTest integrates adaptive sampling to prioritize test samples that provide more information for HT detection, thus reducing the number of samples while improving the samples' quality for faster exploration. We develop AdaTest with a Software/Hardware co-design principle and provide an optimized on-chip architecture solution. AdaTest's architecture minimizes the hardware overhead in two ways: (i) Deploying circuit emulation on programmable hardware to accelerate reward evaluation of the test input; (ii) Pipelining each computation stage in AdaTest by automatically constructing auxiliary circuit for test input generation, reward evaluation, and adaptive sampling. We evaluate AdaTest's performance on various HT benchmarks and compare it with two prior works that use logic testing for HT detection. Experimental results show that AdaTest engenders up to two orders of test generation speedup and two orders of test set size reduction compared to the prior works while achieving the same level or higher Trojan detection rate.},

  abstract = {In determining the durability of its product a firm faces a trade off. Performing a policy of planned obsolescence by making their products less durable implies that the consumer needs to replace them earlier, which thus enhances demand. However, a lower quality of the product will result in a lower reputation, which in turn will affect demand negatively. In many cases, the government protects the consumer by implementing a warranty period. Our paper studies how a firm should optimally deal with this trade off and react to government policy. We obtain the following results. First, we find that the length of the warranty period has an inverted U-shaped effect on the product life time. Second, if more consumers are aware of the existence of a warranty period and ask for a free product replacement, this will increase the product life time. Third, increasing uncertainty about the breakdown of the product also has an inverted U-shaped effect on the product lifetime.},

  abstract = {The integration of big data technology in the manufacturing process has become a norm, and as society's dependence on the digital economy increases, colleges and universities must adjust their teaching methods to cater to their students' needs. In evaluating the success of business-school partnerships, there is a need for common criteria and visualising data analysis results. However, the current educational approach presents some challenges, including a lack of practical experience with software, overemphasis on theoretical concepts, and inadequate training in problem-oriented statistical modeling and big data statistics projects. Industry-education cooperation should be leveraged to enhance the implementation of big data technology and promote its overall development. This paper analyses the shortcomings of traditional talent training models in higher education and proposes incorporating industrial education to address the gaps. The paper aims to bridge the industry-education gap by developing and implementing an Inter-Technology Information Management (ITIM) system for quality education. The ITIM system uses a fuzzy algorithm to evaluate the quality of education and provides various intelligent functional modules, such as group management, financial management, and process-to-process communication. Compared to other integration models, the proposed management system offers superior performance with an industrial education performance accuracy of 98\%, an average analysis, and calculation time of 20 ms and a maximum performance efficiency of 98\%.By incorporating dynamic analysis of industry education, the experimental results of the talent training model have led to improvements in teaching effectiveness, student learning, and theoretical-applied teaching quality.},

Though several attempts have been made to predict the cascading failure behavior of circuit systems through network-based models incorporating the physical laws of circuits, these methods can only characterize the cascading failures triggered by sudden failure modes without considering the correlation effects caused by the pervasive degradation of components. To handle this problem, in this paper, the impedance network is used as a prototypical model and a novel current redistribution factor considering component degradation is proposed. Based on this, two types of cascading failure propagation processes, namely the slow propagation accompanied with continuous degradation and the fast propagation due to the degradation-triggered failure, are quantitatively described, with which a simulation framework for the cascading failure is developed. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed models and to analyze the reliability of a typical electronic circuit system. The proposed model is also validated by comparing the obtained results with those generated from the SPICE software simulation.},

  abstract = {Today, android smartphones are being used by billions of users and thus have become a lucrative target of malware designers. Therefore being one step ahead in this zero-sum game of malware detection between the anti-malware community and malware developers is more of a necessity than a desire. This work focuses on a proactive adversary-aware framework to develop adversarially superior android malware detection models. We first investigate the adversarial robustness of thirty-six distinct malware detection models constructed using two static features (permission and intent) and eighteen classification algorithms. We designed two Targeted Type-II Evasion Attacks (TRPO-MalEAttack and PPO-MalEAttack) based on reinforcement learning to exploit vulnerabilities in the above malware detection models. The attacks aim to add minimum perturbations in each malware application and convert it into an adversarial application that can fool the malware detection models. The TRPO-MalEAttack achieves an average fooling rate of 95.75\% (with 2.02 mean perturbations), reducing the average accuracy from 86.01\% to 49.11\% in thirty-six malware detection models. On the other hand, The PPO-MalEAttack achieves a higher average fooling rate of 96.87\% (with 2.08 mean perturbations), reducing the average accuracy from 86.01\% to 48.65\% in the same thirty-six detection models. We also develop a list of the TEN most vulnerable android permissions and intents that an adversary can use to generate more adversarial applications. Later, we propose a defense strategy (MalVPatch) to counter the adversarial attacks on malware detection models. The MalVPatch defense achieves higher detection accuracy along with a drastic improvement in the adversarial robustness of malware detection models. Finally, we conclude that investigating the adversarial robustness of models is necessary before their real-world deployment and helps achieve adversarial superiority in android malware detection.},

The quantities of electronic waste (e-waste) produced are expected to reach 44.4 million metric tons over the next five years. Consequently, the global market for electronics recycling is expected to reach \$65.8 billion by 2026. However, electronic waste management in developing countries is not appropriately handled, as only 17.4\% has been collected and recycled. The inadequate electronic waste treatment causes significant environmental and health issues and a systematic depletion of natural resources in secondary material recycling and extracting valuable materials. Electronic waste contains numerous valuable materials that can be recovered and reused to create renewable energy technologies to overcome the shortage of raw materials and the adverse effects of using non-renewable energy resources. Several approaches were devoted to mitigate the impact of climate change. The cooperate social responsibilities supported integrating informal collection and recycling agencies into a well-structured management program. Moreover, the emission reductions resulting from recycling and proper management systems significantly impact climate change solutions. This emission reduction will create a channel in carbon market mechanisms by trading the CO2 emission reductions.

According to an annual report from Symantec (ISTR), which performed the analysis among 157 countries. Revealed that Colombia was the sixth country in Latin America with the highest number of attacks in 2017. In all these cases, cybersecurity has become a fundamental factor for the protection of the computer infrastruc-ture and everything related to it, especially the information that circulates In the network, this article will try to explain what is cybersecurity and its different meanings, and based on Colombia because there are weaknesses in the ability to mitigate these weaknesses and therefore seeks to generate policy guide-lines in cybersecurity and cyber-defense.},

  abstract = {The Android Operating System (AOS) has been evolving since its inception and it has become one of the most widely used operating system for the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to the high popularity and reliability of AOS for IoT, it is a target of many cyber-attacks which can cause compromise of privacy, financial loss, data integrity, unauthorized access, denial of services and so on. The Android-based IoT (AIoT) devices are extremely vulnerable to various malwares due to the open nature and high acceptance of Android in the market. Recently, several detection preventive malwares are developed to conceal their malicious activities from analysis tools. Hence, conventional malware detection techniques could not be applied and innovative countermeasures against such anti-detection malwares are indispensable to secure the AIoT. In this paper, we proposed the novel deep learning-based real-time multiclass malware detection techniques for the AIoT using dynamic analysis. The results show that the proposed technique outperforms existing malware detection techniques and achieves detection accuracy up to 99.87\%.},

  abstract = {Computers are one form of advances in electronic and informatics technology; the function of the computer itself serves as a tool for writing, drawing, editing images or photographs, or as a means of storage. Android, a Linux-based operating system, is a smart operating system that can compete with operating systems on a computer. Some of the problems identified include user difficulties in overcoming computer damage to determine whether to repair or buy a new unit, difficulty in reaching authorized service providers, risks when deciding to repair at a public service place, and limited access to information and costs repairing computer damage. This research specifically designs an Android application-based computer service application that makes it easier for people to get service services. The above research results formulate computer repair services using an Android-based platform with Android Studio and MySQL as the database for this study. This application is expected to be useful for customers in terms of time and cost.},

  abstract = {This study proposes different optimal control strategies to eliminate the damage of virus propagation in a computer network with a minimum cost of installing anti-virus software. The model discussed to be developed is a fractional-order SEIR epidemiological model. Unlike the existing studies on the model, it has been considered that the recovered computers may malfunction due to any mechanical reason, and the model has been developed accordingly. In addition, unit consistency for the model is provided. Although there are a limited number of studies in the literature, the control variable affects the equilibrium points and thus the stability of the controlled system. Therefore, the reproduction number is recalculated for the controlled system. Before the optimal control problem is formulated, the existence of optimal control is proved. Then, the optimal system is obtained using Hamiltonian formalism. The numerical solutions of the optimal system are achieved by the fractional Euler method combined with the forward–backward sweep algorithm. The graphs drawn with MATLAB software show the efficiency of the fractional parameter for different control scenarios. Comparing the three proposed control strategies, it is clear that Strategy 1 is the most effective anti-virus installation strategy. In other words, if an anti-virus software is installed on both infected computers and susceptible computers connected to exposed and infected computers, virus propagation in the network can be prevented quickly as intended. Moreover, this is achieved by minimizing the cost of installing an antivirus program, thanks to the optimal control strategy.}
